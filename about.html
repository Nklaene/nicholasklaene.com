            <h1 class="about-header">About me</h1>
            <p class="about-desc">I am a first year Computer Science student at Northern Kentucky University seeking an
                internship for the Spring or the Summer of 2021 (or both). Though I am only a first year student, I
                completed my freshman year
                Computer Science requirements during highschool & will be graduating a year early. Along with this, I
                have done extensive amounts of
                learning outside of school.
                <br><br>
                I have worked with many different technologies over the past few years, & have no issues picking up new
                skills. Here is what I am most comfortable with currently:
                Java, Python, Javascript, Node.js, Vue.js, CSS & AWS Serverless technologies. As far as certifications
                go, I have earned my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification & plan to go for the Developer
                Certification not too long from now.
